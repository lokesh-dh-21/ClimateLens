# ClimateLens 🌍
AI-Powered Climate Impact Simulator

## Problem Statement
Climate change impacts caused by human lifestyle and policy decisions are difficult to visualize and understand in real time. Individuals often lack awareness of how daily choices such as energy use, transportation, food habits, and resource consumption affect carbon emissions, global warming, and biodiversity. This limits informed decision-making and sustainable action. ClimateLens addresses this gap by providing an interactive and intuitive platform that simulates environmental consequences and promotes climate-conscious behavior aligned with global sustainability goals.

## Solution
ClimateLens is an AI-powered interactive simulator that allows users to adjust parameters like renewable energy usage, public transport adoption, waste recycling, diet choices, water usage, and tree plantation. AI-based predictive models estimate carbon emissions, temperature rise, biodiversity risk, and sustainability metrics in real time. The system presents visual insights and future projections while mapping outcomes to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), helping users understand long-term impacts and make informed decisions.
